## Avinash Ranjan Jha: A Profile in Dedication

Avinash Ranjan Jha is a dynamic, educated young politician, thinker, and social activist profoundly committed to the regeneration of his home state, Bihar, and the broader Ganga-Yamuna region.

**Background and Education:**

Born in the sacred city of **Prayagraj (Allahabad), Uttar Pradesh**, at the confluence of the Ganga and Yamuna, and brought up primarily in **Bihar**, Avinash possesses a unique perspective shaped by the shared heritage, culture (Ganga-Jamuni Tehzeeb), and challenges of this vital heartland of India.

His strong academic foundation includes a **Post Graduate Diploma in Management (PGDM/MBA)** with specializations in HR and Marketing from the Institute of Administrative Studies (2001). Recognizing the transformative power of technology early on, he also earned technical certifications like **MCSE (Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer)** and **CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate)**.

**From Corporate World to Public Service:**

Avinash gained valuable experience working in the corporate sector with **Multinational Corporations (MNCs) in Bangalore** from 2001 to 2008, serving as both an HR Professional and a Certified Engineer. However, witnessing the persistent struggles of his home state, particularly amplified by the devastating **Kosi flood tragedy in 2008**, ignited a deep desire to contribute directly to Bihar's upliftment. This pivotal moment led him to leave his established corporate career and dedicate his life entirely to public service and the cause of Bihar's revival.

**Bihar Revival Forum: A Platform for Change:**

In 2008, he founded the **"Bihar Revival Forum"** ([revive-bihar.blogspot.com](https://revive-bihar.blogspot.com/)), a non-political platform conceived to:
*   Brainstorm and advocate for innovative solutions to Bihar's chronic problems.
*   Promote data-driven analysis and policy formulation.
*   Mobilize public opinion and engage stakeholders for positive change.
The forum actively engaged in relief work during the Kosi floods and has consistently advocated for long-term solutions, most notably the **Adbhut Samriddhi Canal** project (initially proposed as a 356 km canal master plan).

**Political Journey: Experience and Ideals:**

With nearly **three decades of political involvement** starting in 1995, Avinash has gained extensive grassroots and organizational experience working with major national parties, including the **Indian National Congress (INC)** (1995-2010, active in NSUI & IYC) and the **Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)** (2010-2014, 2017-July 2022). Within the RJD, he served in key roles such as **State Secretary** and later **State General Secretary**, along with responsibilities like District Convenor (Darbhanga) and District In-charge (West Champaran).

His political work involved not just organizational strengthening but also in-depth **socio-economic, demographic, and caste-based studies** in regions like Mithila and Seemanchal to inform strategy and policy. He actively participated in election campaigning and strategy, contested the local body MLC election from Madhubani (2015), and played a role in peace-building efforts during communal tensions (Madhubani, 2012).

Since July 2022, he has resumed active engagement at the national level, contributing as an **AICC Observer/Coordinator** in state elections (Gujarat 2022, Rajasthan 2023) and participating in the **Bharat Jodo Yatra**. He was also a special invitee at the AICC Plenary Session in Raipur (2023).

His political journey is inspired by the ideals of **Democracy, Socialism, Gandhism, Lohia's Sapt Kranti, and JP's Sampoorna Kranti**.

**Core Philosophy: Development through Data & Technology:**

Avinash Jha is a strong proponent of leveraging modern tools for progress. His core philosophy centers around **"Development through data and technology-based politics."** He believes that data analytics, technology, and scientific thinking are essential for diagnosing Bihar's complex problems accurately and implementing effective, targeted solutions – from flood management and agricultural modernization to improving governance and creating digital opportunities.

**Vision for Bihar:**

His overarching vision is the **holistic regeneration (Punarjanm/Kayakalp)** of Bihar – restoring its past glory while transforming it into a **self-reliant, progressive, equitable, and prosperous** state that leads India's development narrative. He emphasizes **Education, Employment, Infrastructure, Good Governance, and Social Justice** as the key pillars for achieving this transformation, integrating cultural revival and environmental sustainability.

**A Multifaceted Personality:**

Beyond his political and social engagements, Avinash also holds a keen interest in **Astrology and Numerology** (reflected in his Twitter handle @astroavinash). He views these ancient knowledge systems not as superstition, but as tools for understanding deeper life patterns and philosophical dimensions, complementing his rational, data-driven approach to public life.

Avinash Ranjan Jha uniquely combines **technical expertise, management skills, extensive political and social experience, and an unwavering passion** for Bihar's upliftment. He stands as a forward-looking leader committed to finding innovative solutions and inspiring collective action for a #NewBihar.
